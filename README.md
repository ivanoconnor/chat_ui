Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Set up Yarn

```bash
corepack enable
yarn -v
# 1.22.xx
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn install`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.
